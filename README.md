**KitchenAI** is a control plane for AI implementations ‚Äî designed to bridge the gap between application developers and AI teams. Our platform simplifies AI integration with a loosely coupled, modular architecture that delivers production-grade reliability while letting your teams focus on what they do best.

## üåü What Makes KitchenAI Unique

### Modular Architecture
- **Bento Boxes:** Package your AI workflows into independent "bento boxes" that encapsulate complex logic.  
- **Flexibility:** Update, replace, or scale individual modules without disrupting your overall system.  
- **Clear Separation:** Let AI teams build advanced logic in a reproducible and swappable space, while app developers enjoy a simple, stable API.

### High-Performance Messaging
- **Powered by NATS:**  
  - Lightning-fast, reliable communication between AI modules  
  - Dynamic service discovery and routing  
  - Robust support for event-driven workflows in distributed environments

### Framework Agnostic
- **Plug & Play:**  
  - No vendor lock-in‚Äîintegrate with any AI framework or model  
  - Native support for LangChain, LlamaIndex, and custom implementations  
  - Future-proof your AI infrastructure with flexible integration options

## üõ†Ô∏è How It Works

KitchenAI‚Äôs three-layer architecture makes it easy to manage your AI workflows:

1. **Application Layer:**  
   Your business applications call a simple, unified API (just like using OpenAI‚Äôs Chat Completions).
   
2. **NATS Messaging Layer:**  
   This is our high-performance backbone for routing messages and discovering services dynamically.
   
3. **Bento Boxes Layer:**  
   Modular AI implementations where your AI team builds the complex logic (be it LLM logic, RAG, agents, or custom workflows).

### For Application Developers
Your code remains clean and simple:

```python
    # Simple integration using OpenAI's Chat Completions
    response = await openai_client.chat.completions.create(
        model="@llama-index-agents/query", #your bento box client id 
        messages=[{"role": "user", "content": data.query}]
    )
```

### For AI Teams
Focus on building powerful AI code:

```python
@kitchen.query.handler("query")
async def query_handler(data: WhiskQuerySchema) -> WhiskQueryBaseResponseSchema:
    # Advanced RAG implementation with best practices built-in
    index = VectorStoreIndex.from_vector_store(vector_store)
    query_engine = index.as_query_engine(
        chat_mode="best",
        filters=filters,
        llm=llm,
        verbose=True
    )
```

## Self hosting the control plane 

KitchenAI is designed to be self-hosted. You can deploy the control plane and the bento boxes separately.



1. Clone the KitchenAI repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/epuerta9/kitchenai.git
```

2. Bring up the control plane and dependencies
```bash
docker compose up -d
```

4. Creating the Bucket for media. KitchenAI uses S3 for media. For local development, the compose file has a minio container. This only needs to be done the first time. 

you will need to login to the minio container and create a bucket called `kitchenai`.

endpoint: http://localhost:9001
username: minioadmin
password: minioadmin

bucket name: kitchenai

3. Bring up the bento boxes using this demo [demo notebooks](https://github.com/epuerta9/kitchenai-demo)
