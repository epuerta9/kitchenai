- **Data Scientists** transitioning prototypes to **production** quickly‚ÄîKitchenAI‚Äôs built-in LLMOps ensures easy debugging and logging.  
- **Enterprises** seeking a **private** or **on-prem** AI solution that‚Äôs easily auditable and **secure**.

---

## üí° **Example Use Case: TrendSpotter Bento (API-Driven AI Agents)**  

The **TrendSpotter Bento** simplifies complex **AI agent orchestration** into a streamlined **API-first** experience, empowering developers to focus on **value delivery** instead of backend complexity.

### **How It Works:**
1. **Spin Up with One Click:**  
   - Run **KitchenAI** with a pre-configured **Docker Compose** file.  
   - The TrendSpotter Bento Box launches pre-optimized **agent skills** like RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation), summarization, and email delivery.

2. **Agent with Optimized Skills Out-of-the-Box:**  
   - The agent is **pre-configured** for a domain-specific use case (trend detection).  
   - Fully optimized for **RAG queries**, **summarization**, and **data filtering**.  

3. **Developer APIs for Custom Knowledge & RAG Integration:**  
   - Developers have complete control over **customizing** knowledge bases and retrieval behavior.  
   - Use the `/embed` and `/file` endpoints to **upload data** and **apply metadata filters** to **tailor** the agent‚Äôs responses to your application's context.  
   - **Example:** Upload reports, articles, or proprietary datasets and query them using structured metadata.

4. **Flexible Query Handling:**  
   - Send a query directly to the **agent API**:  
     ```bash
     curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/agent/trendspotter/query \
          -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
          -d '{"query": "Find the latest climate trends"}'
     ```
   - Use **metadata filters** for precision control:  
     ```bash
     curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/agent/trendspotter/query \
          -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
          -d '{"query": "Find trends in renewable energy", "filters": {"topic": "climate", "region": "US"}}'
     ```

5. **Zero-Code Workflow Management:**  
   - **No need for multi-step workflow coding.**  
   - The **agent API** abstracts complex **Temporal workflows** behind a single endpoint.  
   - **Durable** execution with support for **multiple agents**, **event streaming**, and **human-in-the-loop interactions.**

---

### ‚úÖ **Why This Approach Works:**
- **API-First Agent Experience:** No need to build custom workflows‚Äîjust send queries via HTTP.  
- **Fully Customizable RAG:** Use the `/file` and `/embed` endpoints to add domain-specific data with **metadata filters.**  
- **Rapid Developer Integration:** No complex orchestration logic‚Äî**focus on your data and questions.**  
- **Immediate Value:** Spin up a **production-ready AI agent** in minutes with minimal setup.

## üöÄ **Getting Started (One-Click Docker Compose)**  

1. **Clone** or **download** the KitchenAI repo (or a sample docker-compose.yml).  
2. **Launch** with:
   ```bash
   docker compose up -d
   ```
3. Once running, go to `http://localhost:8001/api/v1/agent/<bento_name>/query` (or see the docs).  
4. Start making requests‚ÄîKitchenAI handles the multi-step agent workflows automatically.

**Within minutes**, you have a **full AI runtime** exposed as HTTP endpoints, with out-of-the-box Bento Boxes covering common AI tasks like summarization, trend analysis, or Q&A.

---

## üß© **An Array of Bento Boxes**  

**KitchenAI** ships with pre-built Bento Boxes, each **optimized** for a particular domain:

- **Sales Agency** ‚Äì Generate leads, craft follow-ups, sync with CRMs.  
- **TrendSpotter** ‚Äì Grab social or news data, do real-time RAG, produce insights.  
- **Document Summarizer** ‚Äì Summarize PDFs, docs, or knowledge bases.  
- **(More Coming Soon)** ‚Äì Seamless GPT-based chat flows, classification, image generation, etc.

You just **enable** them in a config or pass an environment variable, then your app can call:

```
POST /agent/<bento_label>/query
{
  "query": "Analyze these docs and give me the top 3 insights."
}
```
